# S-nistrosylation investigation pipelines

This repository contains three pipelines for the structural investigation of
different aspects when investigating S-nitrosylation (SNO) sites. In particular,
they were designed with the purpose of identifying and characterizing proximal
Cysteine residues proximal to SNO sites. 

These pipelines were used for the publication:

    S-nitrosylation can induce a population-shift mechanism on proximal cysteines
