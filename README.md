# S-nistrosylation investigation pipelines

This repository contains three pipelines for the structural investigation of
different aspects when investigating S-nitrosylation (SNO) sites. In particular,
they were designed with the purpose of identifying and characterizing proximal
Cysteine residues proximal to SNO sites. 

These pipelines were used for the publication:

   TRAP1 S-nitrosylation as a model of population-shift mechanism to study the effects of nitric oxide on redox-sensitive oncoproteins.
